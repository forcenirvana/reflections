What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	A new directory will be created called "git" ( hidden ). We need to initialize so that git will start treating that a repository and startign tracking changes for any future commits. Updated.
	
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	Staging area is a placeholder for the files which needs to be committed as a change. It'll allow users to make changes to more than one file and committ it as a single change.
